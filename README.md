# aha-secret

Sensitive information should not be stored in a mailbox or chat history.

aha-secret allows you to store a secret message encrypted. Only the generated
link could decrypt the message again. The message is encrypted by your
browser and decrypted by the browser of the person who is allowed to
read it. The first time someone clicks on the link, the message is automatically deleted from the server.
